<p>Using an unmarked straightedge and a compass, we can draw straight
lines connecting any two points and draw circles centered at a point
with an arc passing through another point. By applying these two basic
operations a finite number of times, we can construct a wide variety of
shapes and proofs: triangles, squares, and polygons with different
numbers of sides. This has been known since ancient times. However, many
constructions have proved elusive! Can we “square the circle”—that is,
construct a square with the same area as a given circle? Can we double
the size of a cube?</p>
<p>Let’s see what makes these problems so tricky by first exploring the
kinds of points we can create with just our ruler and compass.</p>
<p>Starting with two points <span class="math inline">(0,0)</span> and
<span class="math inline">(1,0)</span>, connect them with a line, then
draw a circle around the rightmost point. They intersect at <span
class="math inline">(2, 0)</span>. Repeating this procedure in both
directions gives us all the integers along the x-axis.</p>

<p>Let’s add a more interesting point. Keep our initial circle around
<span class="math inline">(0, 0)</span> with radius <span
class="math inline">1</span>, and draw a new circle around <span
class="math inline">(2, 0)</span> with radius <span
class="math inline">2</span>. Where do these two circles intersect?</p>

<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each circle can be represented by an equation, and solving for when
they are equal gives us our two intersection points.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{align}
x^2 + y^2 &amp;= 1  \\
(x-2)^2 + y^2 &amp;= 2^2
\end{align}
</span></p>
<p>Subtracting <span class="math inline">(1)</span> from <span
class="math inline">(2)</span> cancels out the squared terms and solves
for <span class="math inline">x</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
(x - 2)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) &amp;= 2^2 - 1 \\
x² - 4x + 4 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 &amp;= 3 \\
-4x &amp;= -1 \\
x &amp;= \frac{1}{4}
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>Substituting back into <span class="math inline">(1)</span> finds
both <span class="math inline">y</span> coordinates:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
(\frac{1}{4})² + y² &amp;= 1 \\
y² &amp;= \frac{15}{16} \\
y &amp;= \frac{±\sqrt{15}}{4}
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>These are some interesting numbers! A rational value for <span
class="math inline">x</span>, and two irrational square roots for <span
class="math inline">y</span>.</p>
<p>Can we reach a transcendental number, such as <span
class="math inline">\pi</span>? We are drawing circles, so it seems like
we should be able to. This is what we need to square the circle: a unit
circle has area <span class="math inline">\pi</span>, so a square
matching that area must have side length <span
class="math inline">\sqrt{\pi}</span>.</p>
<p>Alas, this is impossible! But it wasn’t until quite recently in the
history of mathematics that anyone proved it. To do so, let us explore
some more general results about the points we have been creating.</p>
<h2 id="fields">Fields</h2>
<p>First, observe that if we only have rationals, then any combination
of addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division will only ever
give us another rational. We can’t get <span
class="math inline">\pi</span> with those alone. We call a set with this
property, such as the rationals, a <em>field</em>.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>We were also able to produce a square root, but that used a new
technique: finding the root of a polynomial (<span
class="math inline">y^2 = \frac{15}{16}</span>). This number is not in
our original field, but we can <em>extend</em> it to include this new
element by taking every element in the original field (i.e., every
rational number), both adding and multiplying it by the new element, and
adding all the resulting elements into the original set. For example,
this leads to numbers like <span class="math inline">1 +
1·\frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}</span>, <span class="math inline">2 +
1·\frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}</span>, <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2} +
\frac{3}{4}·\frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}</span>, etc., all being added to the
original set of rationals. This new set also forms a field—combining any
two elements from it results in a third element also from the set.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>This process can be repeated! We can extend this new field again with
a different element (say, <span class="math inline">\sqrt{3}</span>) in
the same manner.</p>
<p>There are three things we can say about these extensions, which we
will not prove:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Any particular field extension by polynomial root finding has a
<em>degree</em>, which is the highest power in the simplest polynomial
solved for the new element(s). For example, extending a field with <span
class="math inline">\sqrt[3]{3}</span> would have degree 3, since <span
class="math inline">x^3 - 3 = 0</span> is the simplest polynomial with
that as a root.</p></li>
<li><p>Extending a field by a transcendental number has <em>infinite
degree</em>, because (by definition) such a number cannot be expressed
with any finite set of powers.</p></li>
<li><p>When extending a field twice in succession, multiply their
degrees together to get the degree of the extensions considered
together. Extending a field by <span class="math inline">\sqrt{2}</span>
(degree 2) and then by <span class="math inline">\sqrt[3]{3}</span>
(degree 3) gives a degree of <span class="math inline">2·3=6</span> for
the combined extension.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="field-construction">Field Construction</h2>
<p>To return to our problem of constructing <span
class="math inline">\pi</span>: If we can characterise the possible
field extensions from our ruler and compass operations, we can show
which extension degrees are possible … and therefore also which ones are
impossible.</p>
<p>A line can be represented by an equation <span class="math inline">y
= ax + b</span>. A circle by <span class="math inline">(x - a)^2 + (y -
b)^2 = r^2</span>. The intersection of two lines can be found by solving
simultaneous equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
y_1 &amp;= ax_1 + b \\
y_2 &amp;= cx_2 + d
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>This is clearly a linear equation, meaning the solution can be found
with our fundamental operations of addition, multiplication,
subtraction, and division. Therefore, the result will remain in our
field and no extension is necessary. Put another way, if we start with
only rational numbers, using line intersection alone we can only ever
get more rational numbers.</p>
<p>We saw above that the intersection of two circles can be found by
solving a polynomial with highest power 2. This implies the field
extension needed to include the new element will also be of degree
2.</p>
<p>A circle and a line intersection results in a similar polynomial
equation, also leading to an extension with degree 2.</p>
<p>These are the only three possible operations, and using them we only
found a way to extend our field by a degree of 2. We know that multiple
extensions will multiply degrees together, so we can conclude that
<strong>our degree will always be a power of 2!</strong></p>
<p>This answers our original question, with a bonus result for good
measure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Since we must only use a finite number of operations, there is no
path to an extension with infinite degree, so it is <strong>impossible
to construct transcendental numbers</strong> such as <span
class="math inline">sqrt(\pi)</span> and <span
class="math inline">e</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>We can find square roots, fourth roots, eighth roots, and so
on—but not cube roots, since that would require a power of 2 to be
divisible by 3. This proves it <strong>impossible to double the volume
of a unit cube</strong>, since it would require an edge length of <span
class="math inline">\sqrt[3]{2}</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
